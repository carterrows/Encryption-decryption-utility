Originally coded in October 2022.
Updated January 2023.

Program that uses command line arguments and an input file to decide whether user wants to encrypt or decrypt a file.
Encryption produces a ".crp" file with same base name, with an applied encryption scheme.
The ".crp" file can only be decrypted using this utility, which produces a ".txt" file with original text contents.

Use "-E" command line argument along with file name for encryption.
Use "-D" command line argument along with file name for encryption.
